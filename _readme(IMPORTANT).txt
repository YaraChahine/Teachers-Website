Hello Dr. Charbel!

We hope you like our project, we have been working very hard. If you would like to test our project before the presentation, please note the following:

1. We have included a teachersdatabase.sql file which includes our full database along with some dummy data. Please create a "teachersdatabase" schema and use this sql file to import the database.
2. For the purposes of our project, you can add users of type "student" and "tutor" through our registration pages (by navigating the actual website). However, admin accounts are not created on the website (as per our submission 2 requirements!) and are manually added to the database if needed.
We have created one admin account in the dummy data. You can access it by logging in with the following credentials:
email: "charbel.daoud@lau.edu.lb"
password: "G1ve-Us-an-A!"
without the quotes.

We are looking forward to present our project to you. Enjoy!

-- Reem, Yara, Ali, and Sarah
